        <br>Special appreciation goes to our supervisor, Miss Sahar Waqar. This project and contribution behind it would not have been possible without her exceptional support and guidance that has been an inspiration and kept our work on track.<br>
            <br>This Project is dedicated to Pakistan, it's beauty and tourist destinations. Pakistan is an absolutely stunning country. Famous mountain peaks, emerald-green and turquoise-blue valleys, deserts filled with remnants of ancient civilization, And thatâ€™s not even the half of it.<br>
